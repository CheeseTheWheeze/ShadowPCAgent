# Code intelligence

## Repository discovery

- Identify languages, frameworks, and build tools.
- Detect formatting and linting standards.
- Map directory structure and core modules.

## Editing strategy

- Generate structured patches for modifications.
- Apply formatter/linter after edits when available.
- Track changes and maintain a diff summary.

## Dependency awareness

- Build symbol graphs for cross-file impact.
- Identify related tests and integration points.

## Validation

- Suggest minimal test subset based on impacted areas.
- Provide optional full test suite execution.
